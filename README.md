# GAN
First portion of my ECE4553 project. Uses a MATLAB implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network in order to generate faces. The GAN itself was motivated by https://github.com/sunghbae/dcgan-matconvnet

Data of cropped celebrity faces can be retrieved from the following link. You will need to make sure it is extracted and properly named in accordance with the MATLAB script. Data is a cropped and center alligned version of the CelebA dataset. The original images are available at the MMLAB website (University of China in Hong Kong, Multimedia Lab).
